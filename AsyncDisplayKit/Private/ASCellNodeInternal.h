 *
 * @discussion If possible, cell nodes should be measured in the background. However,
 * we cannot violate a node's thread affinity. When nodes are added in a data controller,
 * nodes with main thread affinity will be measured immediately on the main thread and this 
 * flag will be cleared, so the node will be skipped during the background measurement pass.
